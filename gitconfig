  # A much better default than 'matching'. From the man page:
  #
  # Defines the action git push should take if no refspec is given on the
  # command line, no refspec is configured in the remote, and no refspec is
  # implied by any of the options given on the command line. Possible values
  # are:
  #
  # o nothing - do not push anything.
  # o matching - push all matching branches. All branches having the same name
  # in both ends are considered to be matching. This is the default.
  # o upstream - push the current branch to its upstream branch.
  # o tracking - deprecated synonym for upstream.
  # o current - push the current branch to a branch of the same name.
